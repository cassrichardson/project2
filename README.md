# Portfolio Piece 2 - Data Analysis Report on Bouldering Route Difficulty and Star Rating

Hello! This is the repository for my second portfolio piece, "Data Analysis Report on Bouldering Route Difficulty and Star Rating," for Dr. Wiernik's Programming with Data Course. 

## Data: An organization, Open Beta, provides open-source datasets about rock climbing on GitHub. I am using their "Boulder_Safety_and_stars" dataset, which can be found here: https://github.com/OpenBeta/climbing-data/tree/main/curated_datasets

  #### The description of this dataset is: "Boulder_Safety_and_Stars.csv contains the star ratings and safety grades of 24,278 boulder problems collected by Ryther     Anderson using the Mountain Project API. Note that this set is not comprehensive (does not cover all states). However, it can be used to augment to existing OpenBeta database in some cases."

## Analysis: For this data analysis project, I will be exploring the relationships between how much people liked a boulder route (1-5 stars) and the rating of the route (V0-V9+)
